## Inspiration
In the last few years, the amount of spam messages have been increasing. Many of which are scams. This is a serious problem
which Singapore is facing on a daily basis. As such, my group wanted to use machine learning to detect spam messages.

## About the project
We used tensorflow , NLTK and other helpful libraries such as numpy, panda and spacy to train the model to detect spam messages. We
used an SMS spam collection dataset from kaggle, which includes over 3000 random SMS of the NUS SMS Corpus (NSC). *(check the data
folder for more information)* After training the model, we extracted it into a web application using Streamlit, to demonstrate it.

Initially, we planned to do a fake news detector, but we realised that we needed a far bigger data set and 
much better hardware, so we decided to pivot to spam message detection, which is much easier. You can view
our attempt below.
